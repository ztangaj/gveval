You are trying to tell if a candidate set of captions is describing the same image as a reference set of captions.
Candidate set:
{{Caption}}
Reference set:
{{Reference}}
On a precise scale from 0 to 100, how likely is it that the candidate set is \
describing the same image as the reference set? (JSON format, with a key "score", \
value between 0 and 100, and a key "reason" with a string value.)
