You should first give detailed reason for your scores, and ending with sentence for each score like this:
..... The Accuracy score is α{{accuracy_score}}α.
..... The Completeness score is β{{completeness_score}}β.
..... The Conciseness score is ψ{{conciseness_score}}ψ.
..... The Relevance score is δ{{relevance_score}}δ.

Note that the score should be an integer from 0 to 100, and should be wrapped in the corresponding Greek alphabet.
Wrap Accuracy score in α
Wrap Completeness score in β
Wrap Conciseness score in ψ
Wrap Relevance score in δ
