You will be given one sentence of visual caption generated from a complete video. For evaluation purposes, you are provided with a single image that contains three concatenated frames from the video. These frames are meant to represent key moments from the video but do not encompass the entire content.

Your task is to rate the generated caption based on its accuracy in capturing the essential content of the video, as described by both the provided reference captions and the visual information encoded in selected frames from the video.

Evaluation Criteria:

Score is from 0 to 100 - The generated caption should accurately reflect the content as described in the reference captions and appropriately describe the key actions or events visible in the provided video frames. Annotators should penalize captions that include irrelevant details, omit significant elements indicated by the reference captions, or fail to accurately describe the visual content of the video.

Evaluation Dimensions:

Accuracy: Does the caption correctly describe the entities and actions shown in the video without errors or hallucinations?
Completeness: Does the caption cover all significant events and aspects of the video, including dynamic actions and possible scene transitions?
Conciseness: Is the caption clear and succinct, avoiding unnecessary details and repetition?
Relevance: Is the caption pertinent to the video content, without including irrelevant information or questions?

Evaluation Steps: 
1. Examine the Provided Reference Captions:
    1. Read the reference captions that describe the overall video content or specific actions thoroughly to understand the aspects of the video they highlight.
2. Analyze the Provided Video Frames:
    1. Carefully examine the provided frames, which represent key moments or transitions in the video. Understand the sequence and context of these frames as they relate to the entire video.
3. Read the Generated Caption:
    1. Carefully read the generated caption that needs to be evaluated.
4. Compare and Evaluate:
    1. Assess how well the generated caption captures the essence of the video by comparing it against the reference captions and the visual content of the frames.
    2. Evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the generated caption in describing the events and entities shown in the video and reflected in the reference captions.
    3. Check for the inclusion of irrelevant details or the omission of significant elements indicated by either the reference captions or the video frames.
5. Assign an integer scor from 0 to 100 for the caption based on the following dimensions:
    - Accuracy: Does the caption correctly describe the entities and actions shown in the video without errors or hallucinations?
    - Completeness: Does the caption cover all significant events and aspects of the video, including dynamic actions and possible scene transitions?
    - Conciseness: Is the caption clear and succinct, avoiding unnecessary details and repetition?
    - Relevance: Is the caption pertinent to the video content, without including irrelevant information or questions?

Reference Captions:

You should first give detailed reason for your scores, and ending with sentence for each score like this:
..... The Accuracy score is α{{accuracy_score}}α.
..... The Completeness score is β{{completeness_score}}β.
..... The Conciseness score is ψ{{conciseness_score}}ψ.
..... The Relevance score is δ{{relevance_score}}δ.

Note that the score should be an integer from 0 to 100, and should be wrapped in the corresponding Greek alphabet.
Wrap Accuracy score in α
Wrap Completeness score in β
Wrap Conciseness score in ψ
Wrap Relevance score in δ
