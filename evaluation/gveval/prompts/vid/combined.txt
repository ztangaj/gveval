You will be given a caption generated from a complete video. For evaluation purposes, you are provided with a single image that combines three key frames from the video. Additionally, reference captions that describe these specific frames or the overall video content are also provided.

Your task is to rate the generated caption on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these reference captions carefully. Please keep these references open while reviewing, and refer to them as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Score is from 0 to 100 - selection of important content from the references and the video frames. The generated caption should accurately describe the important aspects of the image while including the essential information from the references. Annotators were instructed to penalize captions which contained redundancies and excess information.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully examine the provided image, which includes three distinct frames labeled as Frame 1, Frame 2, and Frame 3, to understand the main content of the video.
2. Read the reference captions carefully to identify the important information they highlight about the video content.
3. Compare the generated caption to both the reference captions and the visual content of the key frames.
4. Assess how well the generated caption covers the main points of the video content as represented by the key frames and the reference captions, and how much irrelevant or redundant information it contains.
5. Assign an integer score from 0 to 100, considering both the alignment with the video content (as shown in the key frames) and the inclusion of key points from the references. Please remember the score.
